# Promises exercise ‚ú®

In this challenge you'll need to create promises to pass all the tests.
First of all open the `SpecRunner.html`, you'll see that all the errors are failing ‚ùå, to pass the tests you have to complete the functions inside `src/index.js` file.

- Inside the `firstPromise()` function you'll need to create and return a promise that **resolve with a string with `done`**

- Inside the `secondPromise()` function you'll need to create and return a promise that **reject with a string with `error`**

- Inside the `thirdPromise()` function you'll need to create and return a promise that return resolve with a string with `done` if the variable `isError`, received as argument, is false and reject with a string with `error` if the variable `isError` is true
